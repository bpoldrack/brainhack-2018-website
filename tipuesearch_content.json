You can report it on the issues tracker on GitHub. And... while bug reports are welcome, patches are even more welcome. ;-) The git repository for this site is hosted on GitHub . If you are not already familiar with git and/or GitHub, read our git documentation first. If your proposed fix is limited to content, then you can probably skip setting up the build system. You can simply make your changes (content is written in reStructuredText ) and submit a Pull Request . The website is generated by Pelican and the template is written using Jinja2 . So, if your proposed changes are more widespread or change the template, you'll need to setup the build environment. Don't worry; it's easy. install pelican ( apt-get install pelican on Debian; pip install --user pelican on other OSs.) run make devserver open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000 And that's it. Any changes you make will automatically trigger a rebuild.","tags":"pages","title":"Contributing to the Docs"}]}
